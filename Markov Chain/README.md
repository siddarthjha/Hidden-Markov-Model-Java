## Markov Model
**A Markov model** is a stochastic model used to model randomly changing systems where it is assumed that future states depend only on the current state not on the events that occurred before it (that is, it assumes the Markov property). 
* Generally, this assumption enables reasoning and computation with the model that would otherwise be intractable.


## Hidden Markov Model
**Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (i.e. hidden) states.
