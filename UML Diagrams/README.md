## UML Diagrams

* A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.

**Class Diagram**

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. 

**Object Diagram**

An object diagram is a UML structural diagram that shows the instances of the classifiers in models. 
* Object diagrams use notation that is similar to that used in class diagrams. Class diagrams show the actual classifiers and their relationships in a system.

**Activity Diagram**

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity. 
* The activity can be described as an operation of the system. The basic purpose of activity diagrams is to capture the dynamic behavior of the system.. It is also called object-oriented flowchart.

**Sequence Diagram**

A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. 
* It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario.
