## UML Diagrams

* A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.

**Class Diagram**

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. 

**Object Diagram**

An object diagram is a UML structural diagram that shows the instances of the classifiers in models. 
* Object diagrams use notation that is similar to that used in class diagrams. Class diagrams show the actual classifiers and their relationships in a system.
