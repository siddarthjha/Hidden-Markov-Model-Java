# Forward Algorithm


The Forward algorithm comprises of three steps:

* Initialization
* Recursion
* Termination

**Initialization**


![Initialization](https://github.com/siddarthjha/Hidden-Markov-Model-Java/blob/master/images/1.png)

The above equation means that the first forward variable is calculated by multiplying the initial probability of state i by the emission probability b of that state given the observable O at time 1.
