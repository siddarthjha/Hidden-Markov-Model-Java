# Viterbi Algorithm

The Decoding problem is asking us to find the best sequence of hidden states Q given the observation sequence O.

Like the forward algorithm, Viterbi is a kind of dynamic programming
that makes uses of a dynamic programming trellis.

**Dynamic programming**: it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.
